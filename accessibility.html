            <h2>Accessibility Pledge</h2>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">We’re dedicated to crafting a conference that is accessible and inclusive. There are around
               four million people with disability in Australia alone, and this number doesn’t take into account those with temporary
                mobility ranges, considerations that are not officially recognised, and all the other things that happen in life that
                 isn’t captured in a survey.</p>
            
            <p class="lvl-indent-content">Our goal is to create a conference that runs safely and smoothly and attracts a wide range
               of people. Putting accessibility first and foremost will ensure that we include the broadest range of people.</p>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">High on the list of our considerations are:</p>
            <ul class="lvl-indent-content">
              <li>People who are blind or vision impaired</li>
              <li>People who are deaf or hard of hearing</li>
              <li>People with mobility and manual dexterity difficulties</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">We are also focusing on:</p>
            <ul class="lvl-indent-content">
              <li>People with children</li>
              <li>People with dietary requirements</li>
              <li>People limited by work arrangements</li>
              <li>People with gender fluency</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">Contacting us prior to the event if you have any specific requirements 
              would be great for us! We’ll try very hard to accommodate requests, but may require extra time and 
              planning, so please get in touch as early as possible.</p>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">We’re excited to be hosted by University of Melbourne! With their 
              generous venue sponsorship comes their great facilities, and due to the nature of the world class 
              University, many accessibility considerations come built in!</p>
            
            <p class="lvl-indent-content">Levels features:</p>
            <ul class="lvl-indent-content">
              <li>Close proximity to public transport</li>
              <li>Well signed entry points to venue</li>
              <li>Drop off points for cars and taxis</li>
              <li>Good surface conditions</li>
              <li>Clear paths leading to all features such as toilets, break out rooms & theatre</li>
              <li>Automatic doors, the use of non-heavy doors, or open-by-default doors</li>
              <li>Equipped with working accessible toilet facilities in the same location as female and male toilets</li>
              <li>Lift with button at appropriate height for people using wheelchairs</li>
              <li>Height accessible counters for a person in a wheelchair</li>
              <li>Good air circulation throughout the venue</li>
              <li>Good acoustics and/or hearing augmentation system (hearing loop)</li>
              <li>Evacuation procedures in place taking into account people with a disability</li>

            <h2 id="somedosbeforethedonts">Toilets</h2>

            <p class="lvl-indent-content">The toilets at Levels will be gender neutral. This means you
               can share a toilet block with anyone, you never know who you’ll run into! This can sound
                uncomfortable for some people, the best way to think about it is that your 
                uncomfortableness can be enabling someone else to feel included and comfortable. 
                Companies that we look towards, like REA Group, have this at their office, and we 
                believe this is the direction forward for bathrooms worldwide. You’re part of a 
                movement!</p>
